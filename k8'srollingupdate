#Update an Existing Deployment in Kubernetes




There is an application deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Recently Nautilus application development team developed a new version of the application that needs to be deployed now. As per new updates some new changes need to be made in this existing setup. So update the deployment and service as per details mentioned below:


We already have a deployment named nginx-deployment and service named nginx-service. Some changes need to be made in this deployment and service, make sure not to delete the deployment and service.

1.) Change the service nodeport from 30008 to 30006

2.) Change replicas count from 1 to 6

3.) Add command a command: ["sh","-c","while true; do apt update; apt install -y vim php ; sleep 3; done"]

4.) Change the image from nginx:1.18 to nginx:latest


Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.



Edit Deployment file 

    kubectl get deployments

    kubectl edit deployment nginx-deployment

replace replica count from 1 to 6 in replicaset section 

add below two command arguments 

command: ["/bin/sh"]
args: ["-c","while true; do apt update; apt install -y vim php ; sleep 3; done"]



kubectl get svc

kubectl edit svc nginx-service

replace nodePort number from 30008 to 30006



Check the deployment and as well as service 
Check pod logs to check whether the commands are runned or not
